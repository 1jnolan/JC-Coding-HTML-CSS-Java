		<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
		<h2>Some basic rules<h2> 
		<p>This is a paragraph, we use 'p' inside <> in order to open the tag and write it.
		Unfortunately, HTML does not understand the enter button, if we want something to go onto a 
		new line we must put a break into our text using 'br' like <br> this </p>
		
		<h2>Using lists<h2>
		<p>Lists are very useful, they help us to display content.</p>
		<p>There are 2 types of lists, ordered lists 'ol' (which use numbers or letters) and 'ul' unordered lists which use bullet points.</p>
		<p>Each item in the list is then given the tag'li'</p>
		
		<h3>My first un ordered list</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Coffee</li>
			<li>Tea</li>
			<li>Milk</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>My first ordered list</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Coffee</li>
			<li>Tea</li>
			<li>Milk</li>
		</ol>
