	<h1>This is a big heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	<p>We use headings and paragraphs to break up our text and make it easier to read. If we have
	a lot of text we can include it all in the one paragraph like this one. <br> but 
	putting in the br tag makes the sentence appear on a new line.</p>
	
	<h2>This is heading size 2</h2>
	<h3>This is heading size 3</h3>
	<h4>This is heading size 4</h4>
	<h5>This is heading size 5</h5>
	
	<p>When writing a paragraph sometimes we want to make words appear <b>bold</b> </p>
	<p>There are lots of other ways to make text appear using the website w3schools for help</p>
